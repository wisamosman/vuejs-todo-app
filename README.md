# vuejs-todo-app
vuejs-todo-app is a simple todo application developed using a combination of Django, Django REST framework, and Vue.js. The repository contains the code for the application, including all the necessary files and dependencies.

The todo app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, and it provides a user-friendly interface for managing and organizing tasks. The frontend of the application is built using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, while the backend is implemented using Django, a high-level Python web framework. The Django REST framework is used to create a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.

The repository includes various files, such as the project configuration files (e.g., .gitignore, requirements.txt), the main Django project files (manage.py), and the code for the todo application itself. The code is organized into different directories, such as the project directory, which contains the Django project settings, and the todo directory, which contains the code for the todo application.
